# comboextractor.py
A Python script that extracts email/password or username/password combinations from a text file. 
The script processes each line, searching for `@` and `:` symbols to identify the format of the credentials and then outputs the parsed combinations into a new file.

## Features
- Extracts **email:password** combinations.
- Extracts **username:password** combinations.
- Saves the results to a file (`combo.txt`).
